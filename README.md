# Secure-Password-Generator

It is a program that generates a random and secure password consisting of a combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and digits. 

The program prompts the user to enter the desired length of the password, and then generates a password of the specified length using a random number generator. 

The use of a random number generator ensures that the generated password is highly secure and difficult to guess or brute-force. The generated password is then displayed to the user on the screen, which they can use to secure their accounts and protect themselves from cyber threats.

I will definitely upload a youtube video also explaing in detail how this program works thanks!!!

The project I developed during my first semester involves a password generator designed to assist users in creating secure passwords. By generating strong passwords, the tool can help protect users from various cyber threats, such as brute force attacks.
